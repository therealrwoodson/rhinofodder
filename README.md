# rhinocount

RhinoCount Version 1.0

The goal here is to create a script that doesn't require that anyone open up the HTML window to edit everything. They should be able to get everything running just by tagging what's needed and letting the script take it all from there and run with it.

Curent logic is:
Tag a text layer with 'count' and 'up' or 'down' depending on the direction.
In the payload put 'start number, end number, time interval, (opt) tag of layer to trigger it'.
If you want the layer to trigger itself, don't bother with the fourth payload value.
The time interval isn't in any exact unit. It's from a scale of 0-10 (slowest to fastest).
